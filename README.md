**Note**: To optimize distribution and maintain the lightweight structure of the PolyAseqTrap R package:

* [demo_data](https://github.com/BMILAB/PolyAseqTrap/tree/refer/demo_data) directory contains the demo data that was previously stored in the *`inst/extdata`* directory.
* [DeepIP_train](https://github.com/BMILAB/PolyAseqTrap/tree/refer/DeepIP_train) directory contains the training data for DeepIP, which was previously located in the *`scripts`* directory.
